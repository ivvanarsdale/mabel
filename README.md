# there is SO MUCH going on with this code. I made this shortly after relearning html and css back in 2020 after not touching it for a year and a half,
and I had gotten bored with the course I was taking. What happens when a fourteen year old with nothing better to do gets bored? That fourteen year old
writes horrible code and tries to test shadows and gradients, except it looks bad because then and still now I don't understand web design!! (lmao)
